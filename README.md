# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
--------------------------------

## Description 

The goal of this project is to increase the accessibility of the website so that users with different backgrounds and different devices may have a more equal consumption of the content provided. Accessibility is something that is becoming more and more relevant as more users access the web, so it is important that I as a developer am able to cater to various user needs and platforms. Making underlying code consistent and logically structured is important for legibility and overall consumption. Through this project I have begun to learn what it means for a website to be “accessible” so that I think past my own device and needs when building a website that I intend to share with others.

## Goals

* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
